<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
    GaoAnge aka Angelica Gao is a dynamic media arts student with a background in Economics and Business. 
    This background has construed a dialectic view on art and media, one that she brings towards her examination and fabrication of her projects. 
    Within her focus on concepts of repetition, simplicity and modernity she seeks to evoke emotive connotations that point towards a commentary on the superfluous fabric of modern society. 
    Her works with an emphasis on dedication and practical effort, shit away from the tides of fast-paced efficiency and output- a purposeful reflection on her time in structured disciplines such as Economics. 
    In her upbringing she found herself confronted with explorative and innovative outlets in the arts, but unappreciative of the deep complexities as a result of her innermost turmoil which was focused on tangible societal results. 
    Towards an effort to relive and reflect, her work now consists of exploring her inner outlets through practical and tangible means, as a circular reflection on the tides of life.
